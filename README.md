# Zalloc
## Purpose
    This is a small library with allocators for different purposes designed to be used in the context of a kernel.
## Features:
    1. Bump allocator
    2. Buddy allocator
    3. Slab allocator
## Disclaimer:
    The library is not properly tested yet so expect critical bugs
    This is not the most optimised code so it won't run fast or be the most efficent and it shouldn't really be used at it's current stage. I will propably add features as I go
